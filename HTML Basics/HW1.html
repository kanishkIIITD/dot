          Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH ComM (Portuguese
          pronunciation: [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaɫdu]; born 5 February 1985) is a
          Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for Saudi
          Professional League club Al Nassr and captains the Portugal national
          team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time,
          Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards[note 3] and four European
          Golden Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 32 trophies in
          his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions
          Leagues, the UEFA European Championship and the UEFA Nations League.
          Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances (183), goals (140), and
          assists (42) in the Champions League, goals in the European
          Championship (14), international goals (118), and joint-most
          international appearances (196). He is one of the few players to have
          made over 1,100 professional career appearances, and has scored over
          800 official senior career goals for club and country. He is the only
          player to score in five FIFA World Cup tournaments.
